With hindsight, we can even affirm that those checks and balances either totally missed some critical points, or were deliberately meant from the beginning to hinder, if not eliminate, the capacity of societies to control the ages-old issue of wealth concentration.

The way this is done, once stripped of its byzantine technicalities, is so outrageous that it allegedly led Henry Ford to say:</p> <p>\"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning\". While there is no definitive record of Ford uttering these exact words, the sentiment aligns with a passage from his 1922 book My Life and Work, where he expressed concern that the public's lack of understanding of financial systems protects the integrity of sound money, as people are naturally conservative about money and would likely react strongly if they fully grasped how financial institutions manipulate the system. The quote reflects a belief that the complexity and opacity of banking\u2014particularly the ability of financiers to create money through mechanisms like credit and leverage\u2014could provoke widespread outrage if exposed.

Depending on the perspective that one adopts, the answer will throw a different light on money.

Say you have goats, make cheese and take it to some grocery store for distribution. Without money, what the store administration would do (if you agree) is to take note of the fact that they owe you the value of your cheese, and allow you to eventually have your fair retribution by giving you credit to buy stuff on the store. Instead of (or in addition to) taking note of that in an internal book, they would give you paper notes that can be redeemed for products. Then, as a matter of fact, you're not forced to use those notes on the store: you can, say, go to the hairdresser and pay for a haircut with them. As long as they know and trust both you and the grocery store, there will be no problems with that.

Why we stopped doing it that way is another question, and the case can be made (see David Graeber again) that there were no problems with malicious user behavior, but simply an organized push by banks to acquire a monopoly on money issuance.</p> <p>Now, this is no place to explain the inner workings of banks (fractional reserves, central bank monetary policy tools, etcetera). We leave it to the reader to fill in the gaps. The points that we want to emphasize are:</p> <ol> <li>In order for the economy to grow (say, you incremeanting PIB by bringing your cheese to the market), mechanisms for providing liquidity (in the form of credit  managed either by the community or a private bank) must exist.</li> <li>When the community provides credit, no one is lending money and therefore no interest rates apply: the resulting growth (assuming the cheese was of good quality and someone buys it; otherwise, the result would be inflation) is a win-win proposition where the community as a whole benefits.

This consent is achieved by embedding the values, norms, and interests of the ruling class into the cultural fabric of society, making them appear as common sense or natural. Hegemony operates across two key realms: the state, which represents the apparatus of coercion (such as courts, police, and military), and civil society, which includes institutions like schools, media, churches, and cultural organizations that shape public opinion and cultural norms.</p> <p>Gramsci argued that hegemony is not a static condition but a dynamic and ongoing process that must be constantly negotiated and maintained, as subordinate groups can resist or challenge the dominant ideology. He distinguished between the \"war of maneuver,\" a direct and violent assault on state power akin to the Russian Revolution, and the \"war of position,\" a slower, more sustained struggle to transform civil society by building a counter-hegemonic culture and winning ideological leadership over time. This shift in strategy reflects his belief that in developed capitalist societies, revolution requires first reshaping the cultural and ideological terrain before seizing formal political power.</p> <p>A central element of Gramsci's theory is the concept of the \"historic bloc,\" a coalition of social forces united under the leadership of a dominant class, which provides the basis for consent to the existing social order. This bloc is sustained through a nexus of institutions, social relations, and ideas that reproduce the hegemony of the ruling class. Gramsci also emphasized the role of intellectuals in maintaining or challenging hegemony, distinguishing between traditional intellectuals, who typically reinforce the status quo, and organic intellectuals\u2014those emerging from the working class\u2014who help develop a counter-hegemonic culture and organize the masses to challenge dominant ideologies.</p> <p>Gramsci's concept of hegemony was developed in his Prison Notebooks, written during his imprisonment under Mussolini\u2019s Fascist regime, where he critiqued the economic determinism of classical Marxism and proposed a more nuanced understanding of power that integrates cultural, moral, and ideological dimensions. He argued that the bourgeoisie maintains its dominance by balancing coercion with consent, often by addressing the interests of subaltern classes to secure their support, thereby creating a stable equilibrium. This idea of hegemony as \"predominance by consent\" underscores the importance of ideological leadership in sustaining social order, a framework that remains highly influential in contemporary political theory, cultural studies, and analyses of media and social movements.</p>"},{"location":"David_Graeber/","title":"David Graeber on Money","text":"<p>AI-generated</p> <p>David Graeber, an economic anthropologist, challenges the conventional narrative that money originated from barter systems. He argues that barter is a myth, as there is no historical or anthropological evidence of societies relying on direct exchange of goods before the advent of money. Instead, Graeber posits that debt and credit systems predate money, with early human societies operating on reciprocal gift exchange and social obligations, where giving something creates a tacit debt to reciprocate. This sense of obligation\u2014\u201cI owe you one\u201d\u2014is the foundational concept from which more formalized systems of accounting and value measurement evolved.</p> <p>According to Graeber, money emerged not as a medium to replace barter, but as a unit of account within complex administrative systems, particularly in ancient Mesopotamia around 3200 BC, where temples and palaces used standardized units to manage resources and labor. These early systems were based on credit, not commodity exchange. The idea that money is a social construct\u2014essentially a promise or IOU\u2014underpins his view, with money functioning as a way to quantify and manage social relations, particularly debt. He emphasizes that money is not inherently a physical object with intrinsic value but rather a social and linguistic tool for measuring value.</p> <p>Graeber also highlights the deep historical connection between debt and morality, noting that in many ancient languages, words for debt, guilt, and sin were identical. This linguistic overlap reflects how debt has long been framed as a moral failing, a concept exploited by rulers and institutions to justify power and control. He traces the evolution of money through periods where credit dominated (Chartalist theory) and where commodity-based systems (like coinage) took precedence, showing that money\u2019s nature has shifted historically depending on social and political contexts.</p> <p>Furthermore, Graeber argues that the modern financial system is built on a foundation of debt, with most money in circulation being created through credit extended by banks. He critiques the idea that money is a neutral tool, asserting instead that it is deeply embedded in power structures and social relationships. His work, particularly in Debt: The First 5,000 Years, reveals that debt forgiveness and the cancellation of debts\u2014such as the ancient Mesopotamian \"clean slate\" or amargi\u2014were common mechanisms to prevent social collapse, underscoring that the history of money is inseparable from struggles over justice, freedom, and economic inequality.</p>"},{"location":"Michael_Hudson/","title":"Michael Hudson on Oligarchy","text":"<p>AI-generated</p> <p>Michael Hudson describes oligarchy as a central feature of Western civilization, tracing its roots to classical antiquity and arguing that it has evolved into a dominant force shaping modern economic and political systems. He defines oligarchy as \"rule by the few, usually the richest One Percent,\" and views it as the inevitable outcome of democracy, where wealth concentrates in the hands of a small elite who then manipulate the political system to protect their interests. According to Hudson, this process is not accidental but a result of deliberate policies that favor the financial and propertied classes, leading to the dismantling of public institutions and the privatization of essential services.</p> <p>Hudson emphasizes that oligarchic control is maintained through mechanisms that prevent democratic reform. He points to the U.S. political system as a prime example, where the Citizens United Supreme Court decision has enabled the wealthy to dominate elections by funding candidates and shaping party platforms, effectively creating a two-party duopoly that excludes viable third-party alternatives. This system, he argues, allows the donor class to select candidates through financial influence rather than popular vote, making the democratic process a fa\u00e7ade. He draws a historical parallel to Rome on the eve of the Republic\u2019s collapse, where candidates had to finance their campaigns through debt to wealthy patrons, thereby binding them to the oligarchy.</p> <p>The financial sector plays a key role in entrenching oligarchy, according to Hudson. By shifting the tax burden onto labor and industry while offering tax breaks to the wealthy and financial institutions, governments create budget deficits that are financed through debt. This debt is then used as a tool of control, forcing countries to adopt austerity measures, privatize public assets, and impose economic reforms that benefit creditors. He argues that this system is not a natural economic outcome but a political choice that serves the interests of a financial elite.</p> <p>Hudson also critiques the role of international institutions like the IMF and World Bank, which he claims enforce a \"Washington Consensus\" that forces debtor nations into austerity and economic dependency, effectively turning them into tools of U.S. financial dominance. He contends that the U.S. leverages its position as a global debtor nation to extract concessions from creditor nations, using the threat of financial chaos to maintain its economic hegemony. This form of \"financial conquest\" is, in his view, more destructive than military conquest because it undermines national sovereignty and economic self-determination.</p> <p>In Hudson\u2019s analysis, the cycle of political systems\u2014monarchy, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and ochlocracy\u2014leads inevitably to a return to authoritarian rule when the populace becomes disillusioned with the failures of oligarchic democracy. He warns that without a fundamental restructuring of the political and economic system, the United States risks repeating the collapse of ancient Rome, where the oligarchy\u2019s self-serving policies led to social unrest and the eventual rise of imperial rule. The only way to break this cycle, he suggests, is through a radical transformation of the political system, including the creation of a parliamentary democracy that allows for genuine third-party competition and challenges to the existing power structure.</p>"},{"location":"Richard_Werner/","title":"Richard Werner on Central banks","text":"<p>AI-generated</p> <p>Richard Werner, a German economist and professor at the University of Winchester, is a prominent critic of central banks and their role in the global financial system. He argues that central banks are not the stabilizing institutions they claim to be, but rather amplifiers of financial instability through their manipulation of credit and interest rates. Werner contends that central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, are not government entities but private institutions owned by member banks, often controlled by powerful financial families, and thus serve the interests of a small elite rather than the public.</p> <p>A central tenet of Werner\u2019s critique is the \"credit creation theory,\" which posits that banks create money ex nihilo\u2014out of nothing\u2014when they issue loans, rather than acting as mere intermediaries of existing savings. He asserts that this process is the primary driver of economic activity, with 97% of the money supply created through bank lending, while central banks create only about 3%. This challenges the mainstream economic narrative that central banks control the money supply through interest rates and reserve requirements.</p> <p>Werner argues that central banks' policies, particularly interest rate manipulation, are ineffective and often counterproductive. He claims that the dominant \"central bank narrative\" is built on five pillars\u2014interest rates as the main policy tool, markets in equilibrium, banks as financial intermediaries, the need for foreign borrowing to fund growth, and the necessity of deregulation and privatization\u2014all of which he asserts lack empirical support and have been disproven by events such as the 2008 financial crisis. He further criticizes the use of models like Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which he says failed to predict the 2008 crisis and are based on flawed assumptions.</p> <p>Werner also links central banking to broader societal issues, including war and economic inequality. He claims that central banks have historically funded wars by enabling governments to borrow heavily, profiting from the resulting debt and interest payments. He suggests that this financial mechanism has been used to serve the interests of banking elites, with conflicts often being profitable for banks regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>In response to these systemic flaws, Werner advocates for a decentralized economic model where money creation is democratized and tied to productive uses. He supports systems like SORA, a blockchain-based network that implements his economic ideas through an elastic token supply, democratic governance via sortition, and a focus on funding real-world productivity. He emphasizes that new money should be allocated to projects that generate tangible economic value\u2014such as infrastructure, education, and innovation\u2014rather than speculative assets.</p> <p>Werner also warns against the potential for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to become tools of governmental control over individuals, advocating instead for transparent, community-driven alternatives that empower local economies and prevent plutocratic control.

The book argues that core concepts of neoclassical economics\u2014such as demand curves, the theory of the firm, and the idea of equilibrium\u2014are based on flawed assumptions, lack empirical support, and are often logically inconsistent. Keen contends that these theoretical constructs fail to accurately represent real-world economic behavior and that the reliance on equilibrium models, such as those underpinning the efficient-market hypothesis, oversimplifies the dynamic and often unstable nature of actual economies.</p> <p>Keen challenges fundamental principles like the law of demand, arguing that utility maximization and the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective demand curve are mathematically and conceptually unsound. He also revisits the Cambridge capital controversy, asserting that key economic concepts such as capital and profit are ill-defined and cannot be meaningfully aggregated. A central theme of the book is that mainstream economics' overreliance on simplifying assumptions\u2014such as perfect competition and infinite market participants\u2014leads to conclusions that are highly sensitive to these assumptions and often fail in practice. Keen further criticizes the neoclassical approach for ignoring real-world anomalies, such as the failure of rising marginal costs to hold empirically, and for dismissing contradictory evidence through doctrines like Milton Friedman\u2019s \"assumptions don\u2019t matter\" argument.</p> <p>The revised edition expands on these critiques by explaining the causes and persistence of the 2007 financial crisis, which Keen attributes to the inherent instability of capitalist systems driven by debt accumulation and deflationary spirals. He advocates for alternative frameworks such as complexity economics, Marxian economics, and Austrian economics, though he acknowledges none are fully satisfactory. While some economists, like John Quiggin, acknowledge Keen raises important questions but argue his claim to have \"debunked\" economics is premature, others, such as George Monbiot, praise the book\u2019s explanatory power regarding the financial crisis. Critics like Robert Murphy and Gene Callaham note Keen sometimes overreaches in his critique, but still recognize the value of the questions he poses.
