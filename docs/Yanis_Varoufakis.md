# Yanis Varoufakis on Technofeudalism

_AI-generated_

Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister and economist, argues in his 2023 book Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism that capitalism has been replaced by a new economic system he terms "technofeudalism".
According to Varoufakis, major tech companies like Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, and Alphabet have become modern-day feudal lords, while users are reduced to "cloud serfs" who provide free labor through their data, attention, and online activity, thereby enriching these digital fiefdoms.
This system is characterized not by profit derived from labor, as in capitalism, but by the extraction of "rent" — such as Apple’s 30% commission on app sales or the monetization of user attention through advertising — which he likens to the ground rent paid by medieval serfs to lords.
He contends that this shift has led to a massive siphoning of wealth, with estimates suggesting 35–40% of GDP is diverted from the circular flow of income through cloud rent, undermining investment and job quality.
Furthermore, Varoufakis asserts that the algorithms of these platforms are designed to maximize engagement by fostering anger and division, which harms democratic discourse and mental well-being, particularly among younger generations.
He warns that this new system, sustained by central banks and governments, poses a profound threat to democracy and individual autonomy, and calls for a collective "cloud rebellion" to reclaim control over digital infrastructure and property rights.
