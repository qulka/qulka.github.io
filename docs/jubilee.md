# Jubilee and Debt Cancellation

_AI-generated_

The concept of Jubilee debt cancellation originates in the biblical Year of Jubilee described in Leviticus 25, which mandated the forgiveness of all debts, the release of those enslaved due to debt, the return of land to its original owners, and a reset of economic and social structures every 50 years.
This principle was also reinforced by the Sabbath Year, which required debt cancellation every seven years.
The modern Jubilee movement, inspired by these ancient texts, gained momentum with the Jubilee 2000 campaign, an international coalition that successfully advocated for the cancellation of $90 billion in debt owed by the world’s poorest nations, reducing their total debt to about $37 billion.
The movement's legacy continued through the Jubilee Debt Coalition, which secured $130 billion in debt cancellation for lower-income countries between 2000 and 2015.
In the United States, the 110th Congress considered the Jubilee Act for Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Cancellation of 2008, which aimed to authorize full debt cancellation for eligible low-income countries and ensure that savings from debt relief were used for poverty reduction, while also promoting responsible lending and creditor transparency.
The principles of Jubilee continue to inform contemporary efforts, with Jubilee 2025 emphasizing the interconnected crises of justice, ecology, and human dignity, calling for systemic change rooted in biblical ideals of liberation and restoration.
