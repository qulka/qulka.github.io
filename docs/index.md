# Welcome to Qulka


> The quote "Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws" is frequently attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty.
This statement, often paraphrased as "Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws," underscores the perceived supremacy of financial power over legislative authority.
It suggests that control over a nation's monetary system—through the issuance, regulation, and flow of money—grants immense influence over policy, economic stability, and political outcomes, effectively allowing those in control to shape governance without direct legislative power.
Despite its widespread circulation, there is no verifiable primary source confirming that Rothschild actually made this statement; the earliest known attribution dates to 1935, and the quote is considered apocryphal by historians.
The sentiment, however, reflects a long-standing critique of centralized financial power, with similar ideas traced back to earlier figures like Andrew Fletcher and Sir Philip Sidney.

## We, in the West, live in an oligarchy

As Michael Hudson [explains](Michael_Hudson.md) (and pretty much anyone can tell from daily experience), western liberal democracy has failed if one judges by the degree to which it has attained its declared objectives. It has, for all practical purposes, become an oligarchic system. This happened because the rich were able to capture our political institutions, theoretically designed to be resilient by a system of checks and balances. With hindsight, we can even affirm that those checks and balances either totally missed some critical points, or were deliberately meant from the beginning to hinder, if not eliminate, the capacity of societies to control the ages-old issue of wealth concentration. (Which had, by the way, been solved in other societies; to give what could perhaps be the most familiar entry-point to such matters for a westerner, we invite unaware readers to ponder the fact that, originally, the [jubilee](jubilee.md) was precisely such a tool).

This simple truth provides us with a lecture key to decode the claim, duly repeated at every opportunity in western mass media, that we're witnessing a struggle between "democracies" and "autocratic regimes". What they actually mean is that in some nations (notably, China and Russia) political systems have emerged that are building immunity against being captured by western financial interests. They are thus becoming sovereign, and putting an end to several centuries of global western dominance that has been used to exploit people and deprive them of their resources, to the benefit of a few.

Here we're concerned with understanding the root cause of all of this, in order to be able to do something about it
(other than waiting for a multipolar world order to emerge and hope it is more benign).
But the issue is, of course, very multi-faceted. There are cultural traits, historical events, geographic factors... Here we take the standpoint that, for current practical purposes, the blame needs to be put on the way credit is managed.
This should mean that economists are in a good position to fix things out, and we must therefore spend a few words on why this has not happened.

This observation highlights how financial incentives can create a powerful barrier to objective understanding, as an individual's livelihood may be directly tied to maintaining a particular belief or ignorance about a subject.
The quote, often attributed to Upton Sinclair, underscores the challenge of persuading someone whose income is contingent upon not grasping the truth, whether in corporate, political, or professional contexts.
This principle applies broadly, from executives in industries with environmental impacts to professionals in regulated sectors who may resist change that threatens their role.

You'll likely have a very hard time explaining to an economist that the so-called "independence of the Central Bank" is an ideological tool meant to rationalize and justify the fact that private financial institutions in western countries have:
(1) acquired an unfair monopoly on the issuance of money; and
(2) used it to misappropriate the surplus of our economic activity.
The way this is done, once stripped of its byzantine technicalities, is so outrageous that it allegedly led Henry Ford to say:

> "It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning".
While there is no definitive record of Ford uttering these exact words, the sentiment aligns with a passage from his 1922 book My Life and Work, where he expressed concern that the public's lack of understanding of financial systems protects the integrity of sound money, as people are naturally conservative about money and would likely react strongly if they fully grasped how financial institutions manipulate the system.
The quote reflects a belief that the complexity and opacity of banking—particularly the ability of financiers to create money through mechanisms like credit and leverage—could provoke widespread outrage if exposed.
This idea is echoed by others, such as economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who noted that the process by which banks create money is so simple that it repels the mind, suggesting that the system's mechanics are deliberately obscured.

So, how is it possible that economists have not collectively raised their voice and guided politicians to fix the problem? Not only that: they've built a supposedly sound theoretical edifice that protects the system, recurring to ethics, philosophy, darwinian evolution, game theory, stochastic differential equations and so on.
[Steve Keen](Steve_Keen.md), among other authoritative voices that could be mentioned here, has written a detailed debunking of the pseudo-scientific state that mainstream economic theory has reached.

There is one aspect of the story whose importance must not be underestimated. Western culture values ideas and longs for the absolute and eternal, often to the detriment of facts on the ground.
It easily becomes ideological and detached from reality, grossly diverging from the scientific spirit that it paradoxically claims to champion.
Economics has certainly fallen prey to this, and the push for serious consideration of actual facts has come from different camps.
At any rate, regardless of the precise dynamics (which are certainly interesting on their own) that brought us here, the bottom line is that economy (and, to varying degrees, other fields of academia) has been captured.

### Common sense

Yes, common sense has been captured too. Otherwise, Ford's feared revolution would already have happened.
But how is this possible? You can fool some people sometimes, but you can't fool all the people all the time, right?
Well, as Gramsci [explains](Antonio_Gramsci.md), that may be true, but there's a continuous struggle for what society as a whole accepts and takes for granted.
Having control over what people read and watch plays a critical role. As we can expect, western oligarcs understand this very well and have thus captured mass media.

With the advent of the internet, things became interesting. At some point, people thought we'd reach a stage of unprecedented freedom, democracy and universal well-being thanks to the increased availability of knowledge and long-range people-to-people exchanges.
It indeed became harder to hide facts as the information space opened, but at the same time other harmful consequences started to reveal themselves:

1. We were overwhelmed by low-quality content, and the simultaneous discredit of traditionally authoritative voices (politicians, reporters, scientists)
led to a further erosion of the notion of truth itself (already damaged by several factors, among which well-intentioned cultural relativism and a permanent push to value appearance over essence in a consumer society).
2. Profilation and content customization fragmented society into opinion bubbles with little cross-fertilization, leading to echo chambers that reinforce ideologies up to the point of extremism.

Both phenomenona are being taken advantage of by our oligarchy. The weakening of our grasp on truth has enabled a direct attack on it by politicians and functionaries who claim, with a sad degree of success, that anything they don't like is "fake news". Big Tech took marketing techniques to a new level and their degree of influence on political movements and electoral campaigns grew even more. Now, oligarcs try to regain whatever narrative control they lost via deplatforming and outright censorship. They can do it, because they own the spaces where virtual exchanges happen (social networks and virtual markets). As [Yanis Varoufakis](Yanis_Varoufakis.md) argues, capitalism is evolving into a stage of technofeudalism.

At the same time, peer-to-peer technologies have been developed and people are trying to defend the original ethos of the web. The battle for social networks might not be lost.

### Credit

Yes, credit has been captured too. But we need to undertand a few things before getting into that.

## Regarding Money and Central Banks

Besides their obvious economic importance, central banks have considerable political power. [Richard Werner](Richard_Werner.md) has studied this phenomenon focusing particularily on the case of Japan. Now, a first-principles explanation of this calls for a deep understanding of what money actually _is_.
But if economists have been captured, whom should we turn to here? Beautifully enough, it's been for anthropologists to answer the call.

### Money

As a first observation, one needs to realize that there won't be a single, unified understanding of something which we've grown to take for granted, shows up on all levels of human activity (from buying bread to waging wars), and is confusingly very concrete and very abstract at the same time.
Depending on the perspective that one adopts, the answer will throw a different light on money. Let's mention a few possibilities:

- Economists like to take a descriptive approach and say that money does three things: serves as a mean of exchange, provides an accounting unit, and constitutes a value reserve.
- From a physical perspective, given that money flows in the opposite direction as physical exchanges (be it products or services), it should be a (perceived) measure of negative entropy. When an imbalance between entropy flow and money flow occurs, the system is not stable and price adjustments should eventually take place. Note also that there is a global multiplicative symmetry, a fact that explains the possibility of _price inflation_.
- Noting the basic fact that money is a social convention and plays an important role in the organization of a society, we can observe a really fundamental property: _money is that with which taxes are paid_ (Chartalism).
- But what about actual history? Money is something we humans invented; paying attention to why and how is certainly bound to result in fundamental insights.
In his book _Debt: the first 5,000 years_ [David Graeber](David_Graeber.md) explains that money was actually born as a symbolic way to settle debts, and the debts we were originally interested in had more to do with honor than with commerce. It was only later that money begun to be used for material exchanges, and this leads to a crucial realization: economies actually work _on credit_.

### ...and Credit

It's easy to understand how economies worked for millenia, before central banks were created and acquired a monopoly on the issuance of money. Say you have goats, make cheese and take it to some grocery store for distribution.
Without money, what the store administration would do (if you agree) is to _take note_ of the fact that they owe you the value of your cheese, and allow you to eventually have your fair retribution by giving you _credit_ to buy stuff on the store.
Instead of (or in addition to) taking note of that in an internal book, they would give you paper notes that can be redeemed for products. Then, as a matter of fact, you're not forced to use those notes on the store: you can, say, go to the hairdresser and pay for a haircut with them.
As long as they know and trust both you and the grocery store, there will be no problems with that. And there you go: money has been put in circulation, just by a simple chain of _community credit-based_ actions.

One can raise lots of non-critical security and trust-related objections, but the fact is that things _have_ worked like this, and now we _do_ have the tecnological means to make it safely work again, at scale. _Why_ we stopped doing it that way is another question, and the case can be made (see [David Graeber](David_Graeber.md) again) that there were no problems with malicious user behavior, but simply an organized push by banks to acquire a monopoly on money issuance.

Now, this is no place to explain the inner workings of banks (fractional reserves, central bank monetary policy tools, etcetera). We leave it to the reader to fill in the gaps. The points that we want to emphasize are:

1. In order for the economy to grow (say, you incremeanting PIB by bringing your cheese to the market), mechanisms for providing _liquidity_ (in the form of credit  managed either by the community or a private bank) must exist.
2. When the community provides credit, no one is lending money and therefore no interest rates apply: the resulting growth (assuming the cheese was of good quality and someone buys it; otherwise, the result would be inflation) is a win-win proposition where the community as a whole benefits. When the bank provides credit (and make no mistake: it will not lend existing money, but create it out of nowhere), it will do so with an interest rate and will, therefore, _misapropriate_ the excedent systemically produced by the financed economic activity.


### The big mistake of cyptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies were born out of mistrust on centralization in general, and centralized monetary policy in particular.
However, they are based on a conception of money as bullion. People thought we needed something like gold, but virtual. 
Without getting into the troubling fact that, as a means of exchange, cryptocurrencies are very energy-inefficient (bitcoin's ledger mechanism, based on "proof of work", consumes ridiculous amount of energy; other cryptocurrencies use "proof of stake" which is better, but still bad), let's point out that they are barking up at the wrong tree:

1. Having a fixed supply of money in circulation is a problem, not a solution. Thus, cryptocurrencies are just financial speculation assets, not quite able to fulfill the role of money.
2. The problem with central banks is not that they can create money, but that they are controlled by oligarchs that put the fresh money in circulation through financial institutions that become de-facto owners of the emergent wealth in a complex economy.

## What to do?

<!-- ### Understanding check

Details are important and can be gruesome to get right. Notwithstanding this, as already Aristotle noted so long ago, true knowledge is attained through acquaintance with the first principles and primary conditions of any subject. Being able to judge a method is more important than mastering the particulars it has produced when pursued by its practitioners. If we've obtained that capacity, we can efficiently navigate complex worlds by correctly _ignoring_ big swaths of ultimately irrelevant expert details. In short, the author considers that the above understanding of our situation is complsete and accurate enough to proceed safely. We must now do something about it. -->

### Dangers ahead

Pointing out the great danger ahead is good to sharpen our sense of urgency and need for strategic thinking as we move forward. Our oligarchy can go, and seems indeed to be going full authoritarian. Technology is giving them immensely powerful tools that can be used for social control:

- Private social networks. They are showing their willingness to keep narrative control by deplatforming people with inconvenient points of view. A substantial part of the population seems to be OK with it, in the belief that what they're doing is "fighting disinformation". 
- Blockchain and virtual currencies. Debanking is becoming more and more widespread, and we might end up having no freedom to earn and spend money. We could basically revert to a hi-tech version of company tokens or scrip redeemable only at company stores for specific items, with the added "feature" that tokens are personal and social behavior can alter their value.
- Artificial inteligence. Currently, it requires huge infrastructure to run, is extremely capital and energy-intensive to develop, and provides therefore even more possibilities of monopolization and consequent abuse. AI might become the backbone of _all_ of our economy, so this is rather scary.


### Our grain of sand

So, we really need to get our act together. What this project is about, our grain of sand in contributing to respond to this situation, is a p2p, serverless tool for local social networks to:

1. Freely express themselves, thereby organically creating their own "narrative" or understanding of the world.
2. Take ownership of their emergent, systemic wealth creation by enabling management of currency issuance and credit allocation.
