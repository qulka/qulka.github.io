# Michael Hudson on Oligarchy

_AI-generated_

Michael Hudson describes oligarchy as a central feature of Western civilization, tracing its roots to classical antiquity and arguing that it has evolved into a dominant force shaping modern economic and political systems.
He defines oligarchy as "rule by the few, usually the richest One Percent," and views it as the inevitable outcome of democracy, where wealth concentrates in the hands of a small elite who then manipulate the political system to protect their interests.
According to Hudson, this process is not accidental but a result of deliberate policies that favor the financial and propertied classes, leading to the dismantling of public institutions and the privatization of essential services.

Hudson emphasizes that oligarchic control is maintained through mechanisms that prevent democratic reform. He points to the U.S. political system as a prime example, where the Citizens United Supreme Court decision has enabled the wealthy to dominate elections by funding candidates and shaping party platforms, effectively creating a two-party duopoly that excludes viable third-party alternatives.
This system, he argues, allows the donor class to select candidates through financial influence rather than popular vote, making the democratic process a façade.
He draws a historical parallel to Rome on the eve of the Republic’s collapse, where candidates had to finance their campaigns through debt to wealthy patrons, thereby binding them to the oligarchy.

The financial sector plays a key role in entrenching oligarchy, according to Hudson. By shifting the tax burden onto labor and industry while offering tax breaks to the wealthy and financial institutions, governments create budget deficits that are financed through debt.
This debt is then used as a tool of control, forcing countries to adopt austerity measures, privatize public assets, and impose economic reforms that benefit creditors.
He argues that this system is not a natural economic outcome but a political choice that serves the interests of a financial elite.

Hudson also critiques the role of international institutions like the IMF and World Bank, which he claims enforce a "Washington Consensus" that forces debtor nations into austerity and economic dependency, effectively turning them into tools of U.S. financial dominance.
He contends that the U.S. leverages its position as a global debtor nation to extract concessions from creditor nations, using the threat of financial chaos to maintain its economic hegemony.
This form of "financial conquest" is, in his view, more destructive than military conquest because it undermines national sovereignty and economic self-determination.

In Hudson’s analysis, the cycle of political systems—monarchy, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and ochlocracy—leads inevitably to a return to authoritarian rule when the populace becomes disillusioned with the failures of oligarchic democracy.
He warns that without a fundamental restructuring of the political and economic system, the United States risks repeating the collapse of ancient Rome, where the oligarchy’s self-serving policies led to social unrest and the eventual rise of imperial rule.
The only way to break this cycle, he suggests, is through a radical transformation of the political system, including the creation of a parliamentary democracy that allows for genuine third-party competition and challenges to the existing power structure.
