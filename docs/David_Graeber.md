# David Graeber on Money

_AI-generated_

David Graeber, an economic anthropologist, challenges the conventional narrative that money originated from barter systems. He argues that barter is a myth, as there is no historical or anthropological evidence of societies relying on direct exchange of goods before the advent of money.
Instead, Graeber posits that debt and credit systems predate money, with early human societies operating on reciprocal gift exchange and social obligations, where giving something creates a tacit debt to reciprocate.
This sense of obligation—“I owe you one”—is the foundational concept from which more formalized systems of accounting and value measurement evolved.

According to Graeber, money emerged not as a medium to replace barter, but as a unit of account within complex administrative systems, particularly in ancient Mesopotamia around 3200 BC, where temples and palaces used standardized units to manage resources and labor.
These early systems were based on credit, not commodity exchange. The idea that money is a social construct—essentially a promise or IOU—underpins his view, with money functioning as a way to quantify and manage social relations, particularly debt.
He emphasizes that money is not inherently a physical object with intrinsic value but rather a social and linguistic tool for measuring value.

Graeber also highlights the deep historical connection between debt and morality, noting that in many ancient languages, words for debt, guilt, and sin were identical.
This linguistic overlap reflects how debt has long been framed as a moral failing, a concept exploited by rulers and institutions to justify power and control. He traces the evolution of money through periods where credit dominated (Chartalist theory) and where commodity-based systems (like coinage) took precedence, showing that money’s nature has shifted historically depending on social and political contexts.

Furthermore, Graeber argues that the modern financial system is built on a foundation of debt, with most money in circulation being created through credit extended by banks.
He critiques the idea that money is a neutral tool, asserting instead that it is deeply embedded in power structures and social relationships. His work, particularly in Debt: The First 5,000 Years, reveals that debt forgiveness and the cancellation of debts—such as the ancient Mesopotamian "clean slate" or amargi—were common mechanisms to prevent social collapse, underscoring that the history of money is inseparable from struggles over justice, freedom, and economic inequality.
