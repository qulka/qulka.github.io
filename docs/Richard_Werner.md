# Richard Werner on Central banks

_AI-generated_

Richard Werner, a German economist and professor at the University of Winchester, is a prominent critic of central banks and their role in the global financial system. He argues that central banks are not the stabilizing institutions they claim to be, but rather amplifiers of financial instability through their manipulation of credit and interest rates.
Werner contends that central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, are not government entities but private institutions owned by member banks, often controlled by powerful financial families, and thus serve the interests of a small elite rather than the public.

A central tenet of Werner’s critique is the "credit creation theory," which posits that banks create money ex nihilo—out of nothing—when they issue loans, rather than acting as mere intermediaries of existing savings.
He asserts that this process is the primary driver of economic activity, with 97% of the money supply created through bank lending, while central banks create only about 3%.
This challenges the mainstream economic narrative that central banks control the money supply through interest rates and reserve requirements.

Werner argues that central banks' policies, particularly interest rate manipulation, are ineffective and often counterproductive. He claims that the dominant "central bank narrative" is built on five pillars—interest rates as the main policy tool, markets in equilibrium, banks as financial intermediaries, the need for foreign borrowing to fund growth, and the necessity of deregulation and privatization—all of which he asserts lack empirical support and have been disproven by events such as the 2008 financial crisis.
He further criticizes the use of models like Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which he says failed to predict the 2008 crisis and are based on flawed assumptions.

Werner also links central banking to broader societal issues, including war and economic inequality. He claims that central banks have historically funded wars by enabling governments to borrow heavily, profiting from the resulting debt and interest payments.
He suggests that this financial mechanism has been used to serve the interests of banking elites, with conflicts often being profitable for banks regardless of the outcome.

In response to these systemic flaws, Werner advocates for a decentralized economic model where money creation is democratized and tied to productive uses. He supports systems like SORA, a blockchain-based network that implements his economic ideas through an elastic token supply, democratic governance via sortition, and a focus on funding real-world productivity.
He emphasizes that new money should be allocated to projects that generate tangible economic value—such as infrastructure, education, and innovation—rather than speculative assets.

Werner also warns against the potential for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to become tools of governmental control over individuals, advocating instead for transparent, community-driven alternatives that empower local economies and prevent plutocratic control.
His vision centers on shifting power from centralized institutions to decentralized, accountable systems that prioritize economic growth through productive credit rather than speculative finance.
