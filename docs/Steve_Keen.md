# Steve Keen on Economic Theory

_AI-generated_

"Debunking Economics: The Naked Emperor of the Social Sciences" is a book by economist Steve Keen that offers a comprehensive critique of mainstream neoclassical economics.
Initially published in 2001 by Zed Books, a revised and expanded edition was released in 2011, incorporating updated analysis and a deeper exploration of the 2007 financial crisis.
The book argues that core concepts of neoclassical economics—such as demand curves, the theory of the firm, and the idea of equilibrium—are based on flawed assumptions, lack empirical support, and are often logically inconsistent.
Keen contends that these theoretical constructs fail to accurately represent real-world economic behavior and that the reliance on equilibrium models, such as those underpinning the efficient-market hypothesis, oversimplifies the dynamic and often unstable nature of actual economies.

Keen challenges fundamental principles like the law of demand, arguing that utility maximization and the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective demand curve are mathematically and conceptually unsound.
He also revisits the Cambridge capital controversy, asserting that key economic concepts such as capital and profit are ill-defined and cannot be meaningfully aggregated.
A central theme of the book is that mainstream economics' overreliance on simplifying assumptions—such as perfect competition and infinite market participants—leads to conclusions that are highly sensitive to these assumptions and often fail in practice.
Keen further criticizes the neoclassical approach for ignoring real-world anomalies, such as the failure of rising marginal costs to hold empirically, and for dismissing contradictory evidence through doctrines like Milton Friedman’s "assumptions don’t matter" argument.

The revised edition expands on these critiques by explaining the causes and persistence of the 2007 financial crisis, which Keen attributes to the inherent instability of capitalist systems driven by debt accumulation and deflationary spirals.
He advocates for alternative frameworks such as complexity economics, Marxian economics, and Austrian economics, though he acknowledges none are fully satisfactory.
While some economists, like John Quiggin, acknowledge Keen raises important questions but argue his claim to have "debunked" economics is premature, others, such as George Monbiot, praise the book’s explanatory power regarding the financial crisis.
Critics like Robert Murphy and Gene Callaham note Keen sometimes overreaches in his critique, but still recognize the value of the questions he poses.
Keen’s work continues to influence discussions on economic theory, particularly in modeling financial instability and debt-deflation dynamics, and he remains a prominent voice in challenging the foundations of conventional economic thought.
